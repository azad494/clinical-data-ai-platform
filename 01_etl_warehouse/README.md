# Project 1 — Batch ETL & Warehouse

This module implements the batch ETL pipeline for the Clinical Data AI Platform. It processes daily clinical data generated by the data generator (from either data/sample or data/raw), applies validation and transformation logic, and loads the results into a local DuckDB analytics warehouse. The ETL follows a clean extract → transform → load structure with a single entrypoint (`run_etl.py`) to ensure reproducible daily processing and scalable warehouse modeling.
